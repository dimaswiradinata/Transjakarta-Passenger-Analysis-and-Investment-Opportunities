# Transjakarta-Passenger-Analysis-and-Investment-Opportunities
This repository contains data and analysis regarding Transjakarta's passenger count in 2021.

**Overview**

The analysis shows that Transjakarta operates three main types of vehicles: Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), Mikrotrans, and Integrated Public Transport. Each has unique characteristics and user statistics, offering various investment opportunities.

**Key Findings**

*BRT*: Despite having fewer routes, the BRT records the highest passenger count annually, making it a high-revenue and high-ROI investment opportunity. However, it requires a substantial initial investment.
*Mikrotrans*: Although popular due to its extensive routes, Mikrotrans is not available for investment. The government's policy to subsidize this service renders it free for users.
*Integrated Public Transport*: While this mode of transport has fewer users compared to BRT, it could offer a higher ROI percentage-wise. It requires a lower initial investment than BRT, providing an alternative for investors.
Opportunities

The analysis concludes that Transjakarta could be a promising area for investment, considering its high passenger count. Both BRT and Integrated Public Transport offer high ROI potentials, although each requires different levels of initial investment.

It's crucial for investors to make informed decisions based on factors like potential ROI, initial investment, and government policies.

**Note**: Investment in Mikrotrans is not available due to the government's subsidy policy.

**Limitations**

All transport modes experienced a significant decline in passenger count in July-August 2021 due to the government's policy in response to increased Covid-19 related deaths. Therefore, any fluctuations related to such external factors should be considered in the investment strategy.
